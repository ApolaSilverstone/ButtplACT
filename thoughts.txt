generally have baseline/ambient stimulation and impact stimulation

also figure out an interesting curve for impact stim, some combination of
intensity and length (and ramp up? technically feasible? probably...)

role seperated behavior:
   tanks: ambient is emnity? own hp?
 	  impact is hits?
		cooldowns reduce ambient? 
		increase ambient but reduce impact?

  healer: ambient is tank&raid hp (weighted? how)
	  impact is tank and raid hits
		scale release from impact to ambient with how big the heals to 
		get the tank up are? bigger = faster or bigger = slower?

     dps: ambient is own dots? total raid dps?
	  impact is attacks over a given threshold? 
		might be interesting if that somehow scales with raid dps
		e.g. bringing 2k to a raid that totals 4k makes notable big
		hits scale even higher?
